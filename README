Comput Biol 7(10): e1002199. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002199

Please cite the paper above, if you use our code or create a derivative work. 

The analysis/ directory contains all the code for the sentiment analysis (based
on NLTK/MegaM). It also containst the geocoding code. 

The student_ratings directory contains Python/Django code to let students rate
tweets (as described in our paper). The Django code assumes a MySQL backend. 

The code as written originally was designed to work with the original tweet
ids, tweeter ids etc from Twitter. A lot of the scripts assume certain files
exist (some of those have not been checked into this public repository). In
those cases some changes will be necessary. If you need help navigating the
code, let us know.
